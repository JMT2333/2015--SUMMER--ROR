### Journal, Week 1

You've just completed your first week at The Iron Yard. You've learned a lot in a very short amount of time. Take some time tonight to review your notes and write them down. Use whatever format helps you get the ideas out: bulleted lists, stream of consciousness, retelling a story. Consider this a draft that you'll revise a few times throughout the week. Put this work in a branch called `journal-week-1` in your `USERNAME.github.io` repo. Don't forget to link to that PR in your _WIP Issue_! Here are some suggestions for topics:

* Ruby topics you've mastered
* Ruby topics you're struggling with
* GitHub and its shiny buttons
* Personal retrospective
* Things about the class that have surprised you

### HTML Demo

I decided that the `index.html` in your `TIY-Assignments` repo is out of place, so I want it moved - to your `USERNAME.github.io` repo. Specifically, 

* make a branch called `begin-html-demo` in your `USERNAME.github.io` repo
* make a file called `html_demo/page1.html`
* the content of that file should be your old `index.html` from your `TIY-Assignments` repo
  * except the body should just have a paragraph tag which says "This is one of the simplest possible HTML pages", and then has a link to html_demo/page2.html.
  * note the quote marks aren't necessary in the HTML document

Next switch over to the next task (About HTML) for some reading and reflecting. Once you've finished that task, finish up this one
by adding a simple 'Contact Me' form to `html_demo/page2.html`

### About HTML

Tomorrow we're going to talk about HTML forms, but it will help you to have a little background in them first.
The [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML) website has pretty good documentation.
Better than the Ruby docs you've had to deal with so far, I think. Not perfect, but good. I want you to read a couple of pages
on there, _and then reflect on what you've learned_ (ie write it down in your own words).

Read the MDN pages for [an introduction to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Introduction)
and [HTML forms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms/My_first_HTML_form). Then write down what
you've learned in the `USERNAME.github.io` repo. Specifically,

* make a branch called `begin-about-html` in your `USERNAME.github.io` repo
* make a file called `about/html.md` which discusses HTML in general
* make a file called `about/html_forms.md` which discusses...well, you know.

Once you've finished those, return to the previous task and finish it up.

### GitHubbing to Know You, Part 2

This week, you'll be randomly assigned classmates to interrogate and a question to ask. Then, you get to update 
_their_ Markdown file in the Student Roster and open a PR for the change.  
It's like freshman orientation all over again, with more GitHub and less chance of embarrassing alcohol poisoning.
For tonight, ask the person in the class whose last name comes after yours (unless you have the last last name, in
which case you go back to the front of the alphabet) for (A) their hometown and (B) cat or dog.
