## About Assignments

Each assignment will be delivered as a directory in this repo that contains a `README.md` file; for example, [the pre-class assignment: 00 -- Here It Comes](https://github.com/TheIronYard--Orlando/2015--SUMMER--ROR/tree/master/Assignments/00--Here-It-Comes). This file will contain all the instructions for the assignment, a list of the minimal requirements, and a list of deliverables. If your work doesn't match the requirements or expected deliverables, it will be rejected. Over time, the assignments will provide fewer and fewer explicit instructions, as you will be expected to become familiar with the process. Similarly, the requirements and deliverables will be enforced more strictly.

## Turn-in Instructions

These are the default instructions you should follow for every assignment. Additional instructions or direction may be provided with a given assignment, but always ensure that you follow these steps.

* Create a **Work In Progress (WIP) Issue** in _this_ repository for every assignment
    * Name it according to the assignment name with your name appended, e.g. `00 -- Here It Comes -- Brian Gates`
    * If tasks (i.e. check boxes) are provided for you in the assignment file, include them as the _description_ of your WIP Issue
    * If tasks are _not_ provided for you (as in later assignments), create your own; you will be expected to break down many assignments on your own
    * Estimate the complexity, difficulty, and risk of each major piece of the assignment with T-shirt sizes: Small (S), Medium (M), Large (L), Extra Large (XL)
* _Check off tasks as you finish to demonstrate progress_; note the progress bar in [the Issues list](https://github.com/TheIronYard--Orlando/FEE--2015--SPRING/issues) for each issue
* Create a new _topic_ branch in your `TIY-Assignments` repository for the assignment
    * Name the branch according to the assignment, e.g. `00--Here-It-Comes`
    * Ensure that you commit _all_ your work into that branch _only_
    * Push that branch to Github regularly to show progress
* Open a Pull Request (PR) from your topic branch to `master`
    * [Add a link to your **WIP Issue**](https://help.github.com/articles/writing-on-github/#references) in a comment on your Pull Request
    * Note that the PR will update automatically as you push more work to the branch
    * Do this step _as soon as you have a commit_; don't wait until the due date!

## Due Dates

Assignments are typically due at 12:30am on the next day of class. Note that class runs Monday-Thursday, so while an assignment given Tuesday is due 12:30am Wednesday, an assignment given Thursday is due at 12:30am the following Monday.

Many of the assignments will seem larger than you can complete in the time allotted. Part of your job will be to analyze the assignment, prioritize sections, and apply time constraints to your work to ensure that you complete some of every part of each assignment. *Always turn in what you have by the time an assignment is due.* 

## Honor Code

You are expected to do your own work. Even in team- or pair-based exercises, each person is expected to contribute his or her own work. You should use all resources available to you, including open-source code, but copy and pasting open-source code is prohibited: you should use it only for inspiration or as a library in a bigger project. 

As a rule of thumb, you should be able to explain any open-source code project you use at the level of describing what its purpose is and how you created an interface between it and your own code, and you should be able to explain any other code you use in detail.

Copying homework is taken very seriously and can result in forfeiting job placement.
