Which of these are valid Ruby objects?
```ruby
1 nil
2 null
3 [1,2,3,nil]
4 { :key => "value", :other_key => ["an", "array", "of", "values"] }

5 params = { :user => { :first_name => "Brian", 
                        :last_name => "Gates", :address => { :street => "Antonette Ave",
                                                              :city => "Winter Park" },
                                                              :languages => ["Ruby", "JavaScript"] }}
```

6 Assuming `params` is a valid object, how would you access the list of languages?
`params[:user][:languages]`

How would you get `JavaScript` out of params?

`params[:user][:languages][1]`

`params["user"] #=> nil`

How would you get the street out?
`params[:user][:address][:street] #=> "Antonette Ave"`
7 Given a `User` class, and an instance of `User` which has instance variables
```ruby
@first_name = "Brian"
@languages = [ "Ruby", "JavaScript"]
```
write a method `known_languages` which has as its output `"Brian knows Ruby and JavaScript"`.

```ruby
class User
def known_languages
  puts "#{@first_name} knows #{@languages.join(" and ")}"
  #or
  puts "#{@first_name} knows #{@languages[0..-2].join(", ")}, and #{languages.last}"
end
end
```
8 Describe the steps involved in taking data in the cars.csv file and getting a list of just the compact cars onto a web page.
1) build a working server - something you can visit a URL and see an HTML page 
2) build a `Car` class
3) write a method that can pull the data out of the csv file, returning an array of `Car` objects
4) write a method that can filter the type of car that you want (compact), based on the `select` method
5) make an ERB template which can display data (@cars = array of instances of `Car`)
6) the ERB template will have an iteration to take @cars and display each car one at a time
7) in the server, call the `Car` methods and set up the `@cars` instance variable
8) pass the `@cars` variable to the template
