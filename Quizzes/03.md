Which of these are valid Ruby objects?
```ruby
1 nil
2 null
3 [1,2,3,nil]
4 { :key => "value", :other_key => ["an", "array", "of", "values"] }

5 params = { :user => { :first_name => "Brian", 
                        :last_name => "Gates", :address => { :street => "Antonette Ave",
                                                              :city => "Winter Park" },
                                                              :languages => ["Ruby", "JavaScript"] }}
```

6 Assuming `params` is a valid object, how would you access the list of languages?

7 Given a `User` class, and an instance of `User` which has instance variables
```ruby
@first_name = "Brian"
@languages = [ "Ruby", "JavaScript"]
```
write a method `known_languages` which has as its output `"Brian knows Ruby and JavaScript"`.
