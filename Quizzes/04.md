Reading in data from a `.csv` file involves Ruby code like `IO.readlines('some_file.csv')`. 
Reading in data from a `.json` file uses something like `JSON.parse(File.read('a_file.json')`.
Why can't they both use `IO.readlines`?

When we set up a `Restaurant` class which read data from a `.json` file, and integrated that class with a `WEBrick`
server which displayed the data on an `ERB` template, there were four `require` statements:
* `require 'erb'`
* `require 'json'`
* `require './restaurant'`
* `require 'webrick'`

In which file (`restaurant.rb` or `restaurant_server.rb`) did each of them go? Why? Why was `require './restaurant'` written differently from the others, and what do the 
`./` characters mean?

Refer to `04_example_server.rb` and add comments explaining what each part of the file does.
