# Retrospectives

A retrospective is a common practice in the industry in which a team looks back over _processes_ in a recent _sprint_(a short period of work, usually a week or two) 
in order to determine:
* What worked well
* What went poorly
* What changes could be made to keep the good and fix the bad

Note that the focus is on _process_, not _content_.

### Good Fit for a Retrospective
"The quizzes were (useful / a waste of time)"

### Bad Fit for a Retrospective
"I did not understand enumerables at all."

*Please* realize that this is a _perfectly valid concern_; it's just not something that should be discussed within a retrospective.

### Good Fit
"I stayed up too late most nights"

### Bad Fit
"This class is stupid, and (I am / you are) stupid"

### Good Fit In Theory, But It Can't Be Helped So Leave It Alone
"We're going too fast."
