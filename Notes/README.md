# General Policies and Procedures

## Timeliness

According to official policy, if you miss more than four lectures you'll forfeit job placement support. What's more, this class moves _extremely_ quickly, so any absence will be hard to make up. Finally, please respect everyone by arriving on time and ready to start promptly at 09:00 am every day. If you must be tardy, please contact Susanna directly and notify the class via Slack, but also note that we count two tardies -- more than 15 minutes late -- as an absence.

## Conduct

Please conduct yourself with respect for the others in your class. This should be considered a workplace, with no room for [NSFW](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work) material. If you find yourself about to do or say something which could reasonably be considered offensive, stop. Likewise, if you hear or see something which could reasonably be interpreted as either offensive or benign, try to assume that other people mean no harm. That being said, if something said or done to you, about you, or around you offends you or makes you uncomfortable, please feel free to inform a staff member immediately. If you do not feel comfortable speaking to a local staffer, you can reach out to headquarters - everyone in the company is on Slack, and our email addresses are publicly available.

**We believe firmly in the dignity of everyone on our team, and students are a part of that team.**

## Teamwork

Software development is a collaborative enterprise, so this class is a collaborative enterprise. Your classmates are invaluable resources. Reach out to them when you get stuck or feel lost; reach out to them when you think they might be stuck or feel lost. At the same time, be mindful of the fact that your classmates are not here solely to help you. They have to read a lot, write a lot, and learn a lot, just as you do. Ask for help, but be willing to take (and give) 'no' for an answer. 

**We're all in this together, and we're all going to help each other.**
